# ProxmoxMCP Examples:
# feat: add VM console management functionality
#
# Implement interactive console access for VMs through QEMU
# guest agent integration. Adds new MCP tools for command
# execution and console interaction. Updates server.py tool
# registration and extends VM tool capabilities.
#
# security: implement token encryption at rest
#
# Add Fernet-based encryption for Proxmox API tokens in
# config files. Updates config/loader.py with automatic
# decryption and maintains backward compatibility with
# plain-text tokens. Requires PROXMOX_MCP_MASTER_KEY env var.
#
# docker: enhance container security with non-root user
#
# Update Dockerfile to run as dedicated mcp user instead
# of root. Implements security best practices with proper
# file permissions and resource limits in compose.yaml.
#
# fix: resolve VM status polling timeout issues
#
# Adjust polling intervals and add retry logic for VM status
# checks to handle slow Proxmox API responses gracefully.
# Improves core/proxmox.py connection handling.
#
# Fixes #123
