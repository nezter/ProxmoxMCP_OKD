2. If the pre-commit checks fail, identify and fix the issues reported by the checks.
3. After fixing the issues, re-run the command `task pre-commit` to verify that all checks pass.
4. If the pre-commit checks pass, this task is complete.
5. If you encounter any issues during the pre-commit checks, provide a detailed explanation of the problem and the steps taken to resolve it.
