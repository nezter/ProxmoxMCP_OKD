3. When adding new coding preferences, ensure they are comprehensive and include all relevant context.
4. Maintain clear and consistent documentation for all coding preferences to facilitate understanding and reuse.
5. Regularly review and update coding preferences to keep them relevant and useful.
6. Update coding preferences with new insights, optimizations, or changes in best practices after any major changes.
