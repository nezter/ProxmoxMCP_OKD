# Issue Creation Instructions

This document provides comprehensive guidelines for Claude Code when creating GitHub issues in the ProxmoxMCP repository. Follow these instructions to ensure consistent, well-structured issues that align with project standards and facilitate efficient resolution.

## Pre-Creation Analysis

### 1. Memory and Context Research
- **ALWAYS start** by using `get_all_coding_preferences` to understand existing patterns
- Use `search_coding_preferences` to find related implementations or similar issues
- Review existing open issues to avoid duplicates: `gh issue list`
- Check the roadmap (`docs/ROADMAP.md`) to understand project priorities

### 2. Issue Classification
Determine the appropriate issue type based on the problem or request:

- **bug**: Something isn't working correctly
- **enhancement**: New feature or request  
- **security**: Security-related issues or improvements
- **documentation**: Improvements or additions to documentation
- **performance**: Performance-related issues or improvements
- **question**: Further information is requested

### 3. Scope and Impact Assessment
Identify which ProxmoxMCP components are affected:
- **component:server** - Core MCP server implementation
- **component:config** - Configuration system and loading
- **component:tools** - MCP tool implementations  
- **component:formatting** - Output formatting and theming
- **component:docker** - Docker and containerization
- **component:authentication** - Authentication and security
- **component:api** - Proxmox API integration
- **component:testing** - Test suite and testing infrastructure

## Issue Structure and Content

### 4. Title Format
Use clear, descriptive titles following these patterns:

## ProxmoxMCP-Specific Considerations

### 7. Architectural Alignment
Ensure the issue aligns with ProxmoxMCP architecture:
- **MCP Protocol Compliance**: How does this integrate with MCP standards?
- **Proxmox API Integration**: What Proxmox APIs are involved?
- **Tool Organization**: Which tools or tool categories are affected?
- **Configuration Management**: Are config changes needed?
- **Rich Formatting**: How should output be formatted?

### 8. Security and Privacy
- **Never include sensitive information** (tokens, passwords, IPs)
- **Redact configuration files** before pasting
- **Consider security implications** of all requests
- **Mark security issues appropriately** with security labels

### 9. Integration Points
Consider how the issue relates to:
- **Existing MCP tools** and their functionality
- **Proxmox VE versions** and compatibility
- **Docker deployment** scenarios
- **Authentication mechanisms** and token management
- **Configuration encryption** and security

## Issue Lifecycle Management

### 10. Initial Creation
- **Use templates** when available
- **Assign appropriate labels** from the start

- **Missing component identification** 
- **No acceptance criteria** for enhancements
- **Including sensitive information** in public issues
- **Duplicate issues** without checking existing ones
- **Wrong priority assignment** (everything isn't critical)
- **Missing reproduction steps** for bugs
- **No consideration of ProxmoxMCP architecture**

### Quality Issues:

## Integration with Development Workflow

### 12. Roadmap Alignment
- **Check roadmap phases** for priority alignment
- **Consider implementation timeline** relative to project goals
- **Identify dependencies** on other roadmap items

### 13. Automation Integration
- **Label for Claude Code** if suitable for automation
- **Consider autofix.ci** implications for code quality
- **Plan for automated testing** and validation

### 14. Documentation Impact
- **Identify documentation updates** needed
- **Plan for README changes** if user-facing
- **Consider workflow documentation** updates

This systematic approach to issue creation ensures that all GitHub issues are well-structured, properly categorized, and contain the information needed for efficient resolution while maintaining ProxmoxMCP's quality standards and architectural integrity.
