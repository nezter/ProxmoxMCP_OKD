## ProxmoxMCP-Specific Considerations

### 6. MCP Protocol Compliance

When creating issues related to MCP functionality:

- **Protocol Version**: Specify which MCP protocol version is affected
- **Tool Categories**: Identify which MCP tool categories are involved
- **Resource Management**: Consider impact on MCP resource handling
- **Client Compatibility**: Assess effects on MCP client interactions

### 7. Proxmox Integration Specifics

For Proxmox VE related issues:

- **API Version Compatibility**: Specify Proxmox VE API version requirements
- **Authentication Methods**: Consider PAM, PVE, or API token impacts
- **Node vs Cluster**: Specify if issue affects single node or cluster operations
- **Resource Types**: Identify affected Proxmox resources (VMs, LXC, storage, network)

### 8. Security and Privacy

Always consider security implications:

- **Credential Handling**: How does the issue affect credential management?
- **Data Exposure**: What sensitive data might be exposed?
- **Network Security**: Are there network-level security concerns?
- **Access Control**: How does this affect user permissions and access?

## Issue Lifecycle Management

### 9. Initial Triage Process

After creating an issue:

1. **Automatic Labels**: `status:triage` is automatically applied
2. **Community Review**: Issues are reviewed within 48 hours
3. **Priority Assignment**: Critical issues get immediate attention
4. **Component Assignment**: Relevant maintainers are notified

### 10. Issue Updates and Communication

#### Progress Updates

- Provide regular updates for long-running issues
- Tag relevant maintainers when additional input is needed
- Update labels as status changes (in-progress, blocked, etc.)

#### Community Engagement

- Be responsive to questions and clarification requests
- Provide additional context when requested
- Test proposed solutions and provide feedback

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] **All relevant labels are applied**
- [ ] **Template is fully completed**
- [ ] **Examples or reproduction steps are provided**
- [ ] **Security implications are considered**
- [ ] **Related issues are referenced**
- [ ] **Configuration details are included (sanitized)**

### 12. Content Quality Standards

- **Include Context**: Provide environment and configuration details
- **Show Examples**: Include code snippets, commands, or screenshots
- **Consider Impact**: Explain how this affects users or the project
- **Suggest Solutions**: Propose potential fixes or workarounds when possible

## Examples and Best Practices

### 13. Good Issue Examples

#### Example 1: Clear Bug Report

```
[BUG] VM startup command fails with authentication timeout

## Summary
When executing VM startup commands through ProxmoxMCP, operations timeout after 30 seconds with authentication errors, even with valid credentials.

## Environment
- ProxmoxMCP Version: 0.3.0
- Proxmox VE Version: 8.1.4
- Platform: Docker (Alpine Linux)
- Python Version: 3.11.6

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Configure ProxmoxMCP with API token authentication
2. Execute: `tools/vm_start.py --vm-id 100`
3. Wait for timeout error

## Expected Behavior
VM should start successfully within configured timeout period.

## Actual Behavior
Operation fails with: "Authentication timeout after 30 seconds"
```

#### Example 2: Well-Structured Enhancement

```
[ENHANCEMENT] Add batch operations for VM management

## Summary
Enable batch operations for common VM tasks (start, stop, reboot) to improve efficiency when managing multiple VMs.

## Use Case
System administrators managing large VM deployments need to perform operations on multiple VMs simultaneously rather than executing commands individually.

## Proposed Implementation
Add batch operation support to existing VM management tools with proper error handling and progress reporting.
```

### 14. Anti-Patterns to Avoid

#### Poor Examples

❌ **Vague Title**: "VM stuff broken"
❌ **Missing Context**: "It doesn't work on my system"
❌ **No Reproduction Steps**: "Random errors sometimes"
❌ **Multiple Issues**: Combining unrelated problems in one issue
❌ **Missing Labels**: Not categorizing or prioritizing the issue

## Integration with Development Workflow

### 15. Issue-to-PR Workflow

1. **Issue Creation**: Follow guidelines in this document
2. **Discussion**: Engage with maintainers for clarification
3. **Assignment**: Issue is assigned to developer or taken by community
4. **Development**: Work begins with reference to issue number
5. **Pull Request**: PR links back to issue for tracking
6. **Review**: Code review process includes issue validation
7. **Closure**: Issue is closed when PR is merged

### 16. Branch Naming Convention

When working on issues, use branch names that reference the issue:

- `fix/issue-123-vm-timeout-errors`
- `feature/issue-456-batch-operations`
- `security/issue-789-auth-improvements`

### 17. Commit Message Format

Reference issues in commit messages:

```
fix: resolve VM startup timeout issues

- Increase default timeout from 30s to 60s
- Add retry logic for authentication failures
- Improve error messaging for timeout scenarios

Fixes #123
```

## Conclusion
