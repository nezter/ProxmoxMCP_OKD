# Branch analysis

Comprehensive branch analysis and merge strategy workflow: $ARGUMENTS

This workflow systematically analyzes all branches to optimize merge strategy and maintain branch purpose alignment. Execute each phase methodically and maintain detailed analysis throughout.

## Phase 1: Branch Discovery and Initial Assessment

Step 1.1: **Enumerate All Branches**

```bash
# Get all branches with last commit info
git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short) %(committerdate) %(authorname) %(subject)' refs/heads/ --sort=-committerdate
```

Step 1.2: **Identify Active Development Branches**

- Focus on branches modified within the last 30 days
- Exclude main/master and any deployment branches
- Note branch naming patterns (feature/, bugfix/, chore/, etc.)

Step 1.3: **Create Branch Analysis Matrix**
For each active branch, create an initial assessment:

- Branch name and inferred purpose
- Last activity date and author
- Commit count vs main
- Estimated complexity (file count in diff)

## Phase 2: Detailed Diff Analysis Per Branch

For each branch identified in Phase 1, perform comprehensive analysis:

Step 2.1: **Get Complete Diff Against Main**

```bash
# For each branch, get detailed diff
git diff main..BRANCH_NAME --name-status
git diff main..BRANCH_NAME --stat
git log main..BRANCH_NAME --oneline
```

Step 2.2: **Categorize Changes by Type**
Analyze each changed file and categorize:

A. **Infrastructure/Tooling Changes**

- Build configuration (package.json, Dockerfile, CI/CD)
- Linting rules, formatters, type definitions
- Development tooling and scripts
- Documentation updates (README, CONTRIBUTING)

B. **Code Quality Improvements**

- Refactoring without functional changes
- Performance optimizations
- Error handling improvements
- Code style consistency fixes
- Security enhancements

C. **Feature-Specific Implementation**

- New functionality directly related to branch purpose
- Feature-specific tests and documentation
- API changes specific to the feature
- Feature-specific configuration

D. **Bug Fixes**

- General bug fixes unrelated to feature
- Feature-specific bug fixes

Step 2.3: **Cross-Reference with Branch Purpose**
For each branch, extract the intended purpose from:

- Branch name (feature/mcp-claude-sdk-integration)
- Initial commit messages
- Any associated issues or PRs
- Code changes that clearly indicate intent

## Phase 3: Merge Strategy Analysis

Step 3.1: **Immediate Merge Candidates**
Identify changes that should be merged to main immediately:

**High-Priority Immediate Merge:**

- Critical bug fixes affecting main branch
- Security improvements
- CI/CD fixes that benefit all development
- Linting/formatting rule updates
- Documentation improvements
- Development tooling enhancements

**Medium-Priority Immediate Merge:**

- Code quality refactoring with no functional impact
- Performance optimizations in shared code
- Test infrastructure improvements
- Configuration management improvements

Step 3.2: **Branch-Specific Retention**
Changes that should remain in feature branch:

- Incomplete feature implementations
- Feature-specific tests for unreleased functionality
- Experimental code or work-in-progress
- Breaking changes that require coordination
- Feature-specific documentation for unreleased features

Step 3.3: **Anomaly Detection**
Flag branches with concerning patterns:

- Feature branches with extensive unrelated changes
- Old branches with changes that should have been merged
- Branches with conflicting approaches to same problem
- Branches that might have merge conflicts

## Phase 4: Strategic Recommendations

Step 4.1: **Generate Merge Recommendations**
For each branch, create specific recommendations:

1. **Immediate Action Items:**
   - List specific files/changes for immediate cherry-pick to main
   - Estimated effort and risk assessment
   - Suggested PR title and description

2. **Branch Continuation Strategy:**
   - What should remain in the branch
   - Estimated completion timeline
   - Dependencies and blockers

3. **Branch Hygiene Improvements:**
   - Suggestions for better branch management
   - Recommended rebasing or cleanup actions

Step 4.2: **Create Implementation Plan**
Generate a prioritized action plan:

```markdown
## Branch Analysis Summary

### Immediate Merge Queue (Priority Order)
1. [Branch Name] - [Specific Changes] - [Estimated Effort]
2. [Branch Name] - [Specific Changes] - [Estimated Effort]

### Cherry-Pick Candidates
- Branch: feature/mcp-claude-sdk-integration
  - Files for immediate merge: eslint.config.js, .github/workflows/quality.yml
  - Reason: Linting improvements benefit all development
  - Action: Create PR "Improve linting configuration from feature branch"

### Branch Continuation Recommendations
- Branch: feature/mcp-claude-sdk-integration
  - Keep: src/mcp-integration/, tests/mcp/, docs/mcp-integration.md
  - Estimated completion: 2-3 weeks
  - Blockers: API design finalization

### Branch Hygiene Actions
- [Branch Name]: Rebase against current main, resolve conflicts
- [Branch Name]: Consider splitting into smaller focused branches
```

## Phase 5: Execution and Automation

Step 5.1: **Create Automated Actions**
Generate specific git commands for immediate execution:

```bash
# Example cherry-pick operations
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git checkout -b chore/quality-improvements-from-feature-branches

# Cherry-pick specific commits
git cherry-pick -x [commit-hash] # Quality improvements from feature/branch-a
git cherry-pick -x [commit-hash] # Documentation from feature/branch-b
```

Step 5.2: **Integration with Project Automation**
Create follow-up actions that integrate with your existing CI/CD:

- Generate GitHub issues for immediate merge PRs
- Create tracking issues for branch completion
- Update project documentation with branch status
- Schedule follow-up branch analysis

## Phase 6: Reporting and Documentation

Step 6.1: **Create Comprehensive Report**
Generate detailed report including:

- Executive summary of findings
- Branch-by-branch analysis
- Immediate action items with timelines
- Long-term branch strategy recommendations
- Metrics: lines of code, file changes, estimated merge complexity

Step 6.2: **Update Project Documentation**

- Update @CONTRIBUTING.md with branch management insights
- Create or update branch strategy documentation
- Document any new processes discovered during analysis

## Special Considerations for ProxmoxMCP Project

**Domain-Specific Analysis:**

- Ensure MCP server changes stay in appropriate branches
- Verify Proxmox API integration changes align with feature goals
- Check that configuration examples match their intended branches
- Validate that documentation updates correspond to feature completeness

**Quality Automation Integration:**

- Leverage your existing pytest && black . && mypy . && ruff check . pipeline
- Consider how immediate merges affect your GitHub automation workflows
- Ensure changes don't break your claude-issue-assignment automation

**Security and Configuration Review:**

- Pay special attention to authentication and API key handling changes
- Review any Proxmox configuration changes for security implications
- Ensure MCP server configurations are properly scoped

## Report Generation and Storage

Step 6.1: **Create Report Directory Structure**

```bash
# Create reports directory if it doesn't exist
mkdir -p .claude/reports/branch-analysis
```

Step 6.2: **Generate Timestamped Report**
Save the complete analysis to a timestamped file:

**Report Location:** @.claude/reports/branch-analysis/

Example: `.claude/reports/branch-analysis/branch-analysis-20241217-143022.md`

Step 6.3: **Create Current Analysis Symlink**

```bash
# Create symlink to latest report for easy access
ln -sf branch-analysis-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).md .claude/reports/branch-analysis/latest.md
```

## Output Format

Save the analysis in this structured format to the report file:

```markdown
# Branch Analysis Report - [Date]
**Report Location:** .claude/reports/branch-analysis/branch-analysis-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md
**Analysis Scope:** $ARGUMENTS
**Git Commit:** $(git rev-parse HEAD)

## Executive Summary

## Follow-up Recommendations
[Strategic improvements...]

## Report Metadata
- Analysis Duration: X minutes
- Branches Examined: [list]

Step 6.4: **Update Analysis Index**
Maintain an index of all branch analyses:

**Index Location:** @.claude/reports/branch-analysis/INDEX.md

```markdown
# Branch Analysis History

```

**Important:**

1. Always save the complete report to the timestamped file before executing any git operations
2. Present the saved report location for easy reference
3. This analysis is meant to inform decisions, not automatically execute changes
4. The report serves as documentation for future development planning
